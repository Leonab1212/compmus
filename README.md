I will be analising to the jazz standard ornithology, first recorded by Charlie Parker. Ornithology is a refference to Parkers nickname "Bird". Jazz standards often differ from one another quite alot, yet ornithology is one among them that is particularly well known for all the different recordings. One reason for this is that the jazz standerd has also been recorded under another name "How high the Moon". which follows the exact same standard, but then more slowly. This is immediately one of the clusters for that we could annalize the standard, the tempo of the recording. Yet, not only as "how high the Moon" is the tempo low. It would be interesting to see how spotify characterizes these differenses, timing among one of them, in the lables  and statistics labled upon the different recordings. 

I've created a playlist in which I have, up til now, added 92 ornithology recordings. 
After getting the features of these recordings, one of the first things you can see is that there is a vast difference in popularity ranging from 0 to 40. As a refference, disneys own popular songs playlist has a popularity range of 13-74. 
As I was expecting beforehand, the tempo also is a field in which there is a lot of difference. The slowest tempo at 73, and the fastest as 176. These are just a couple of fields where all of these recordings differ in, some recordings are even in a minor key, as apposed to a more usual major key. Interestingly there are two definate outliers in duration of the recording. all recordings lie between 141507s and 668240s, yet there is one recording of only 43147s which is a different order of magnitude, and 4 times slower then the next slowest. The other outlier is a duration of 926333s, which is 1/3 times longer then the next longest. The median duration is 314720. So I do consicer the above said odurations as outliers.

Piece
Jazz standards like Gershwin’s ‘Summertime’ have been covered by countless artists. Make as complete a list as possible from the Spotify catalogue. How do the covers differ from each other? Is it possible to cluster the covers into groups? How could you interpret those clusters?

Write a short description (250–500 words) of your corpus and your preliminary findings.

What is the corpus, what does is represent, and how well does it represent that?

Summarise some of your most interesting first findings with Spotify features.

Which features seem promising for identifying similarities or differences related to your research question? Why? 

Be sure to support your summary with some quantitative results, e.g., As measured by Spotify, the later albums seem to have a much higher valence (M = 0.8, SD = 0.1) than the early albums (M = 0.4, SD = 0.3).

Briefly mention any outliers or extreme values in your corpus and why you think you should include or exclude those outliers in future weeks.

Publish your description online (e.g., as README.md in a Github page) and submit a link to it on Canvas.
