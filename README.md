## Analysing Ornithology


I will be analising to the jazz standard ornithology, first recorded by Charlie Parker. Ornithology is a refference to Parkers nickname "Bird". Jazz standards often differ from one another quite alot, yet ornithology is one among them that is particularly well known for all the different recordings. One reason for this is that the jazz standerd has also been recorded under another name "How high the Moon", which follows the exact same standard, but in a slower tempo. This is immediately one of the aspects for which we could annalize the standard, the tempo of the recording. Yet, not only as "how high the Moon" is the tempo of this standard low, some recordings of How High the Moon are actually faster then some Ornithology recordings. It would be interesting to see how spotify characterizes these differenses, timing among one of them, in the lables  and statistics labled upon the different recordings. 

I've created a playlist in which I have, up til now, added 92 ornithology recordings. 
After getting the features of these recordings, one of the first things you can see is that there is a vast difference in popularity ranging from 0 to 40. As a refference, disneys own popular songs playlist has a popularity range of 13-74. 
As I was expecting beforehand, the tempo also is a field in which there is a lot of difference. The slowest tempo at 73, and the fastest as 176. These are just a couple of fields where all of these recordings differ in, some recordings are even in a minor key, as apposed to a more usual major key. Interestingly there are two definate outliers in duration of the recording. all recordings lie between 141507s and 668240s, yet there is one recording of only 43147s which is a different order of magnitude, and 4 times slower then the next slowest. The other outlier is a duration of 926333s, which is 1/3 times longer then the next longest. The median duration is 314720. So I do consicer the above said odurations as outliers.

Enrich your findings from last week with one or more data visualisations – including tables, if desired – and incorporate these visualisations into your text. Where these visualisations suggest new findings or patterns, discuss them. 

Focus on the quality of the visualisations rather than quantity. In particular, consider some of Tufte’s classical design principles.

Have you maximised the amount of data displayed in your visualisation, making full use of ggplot tools like colour, fill, faceting, and text labels for outliers?
Have you reduced extraneous ‘chart junk’ as much as possible, for example, by replacing legends with text labels and making thoughtful choices about the axis limits and labels?
Does your visualisation have a clear story to tell that invokes curiosity about your research question?
