Be sure to support your summary with some quantitative results, e.g., As measured by Spotify, the later albums seem to have a much higher valence (M = 0.8, SD = 0.1) than the early albums (M = 0.4, SD = 0.3).
Briefly mention any outliers or extreme values in your corpus and why you think you should include or exclude those outliers in future weeks.
Publish your description online (e.g., as README.md in a Github page) and submit a link to it on Canvas.
