Jazz standards like Gershwin’s ‘Summertime’ have been covered by countless artists. Make as complete a list as possible from the Spotify catalogue. How do the covers differ from each other? Is it possible to cluster the covers into groups? How could you interpret those clusters?



Write a short description (250–500 words) of your corpus and your preliminary findings.

What is the corpus, what does is represent, and how well does it represent that?
Summarise some of your most interesting first findings with Spotify features. Which features seem promising for identifying similarities or differences related to your research question? Why? Be sure to support your summary with some quantitative results, e.g., As measured by Spotify, the later albums seem to have a much higher valence (M = 0.8, SD = 0.1) than the early albums (M = 0.4, SD = 0.3).
Briefly mention any outliers or extreme values in your corpus and why you think you should include or exclude those outliers in future weeks.
Publish your description online (e.g., as README.md in a Github page) and submit a link to it on Canvas.
